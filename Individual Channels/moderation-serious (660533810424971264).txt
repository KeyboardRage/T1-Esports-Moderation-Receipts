As Sean has mentioned yesterday, we were essentially left to our devices on how to moderate this discord server over the past year. It’s not like Sean started spouting potentially controversial statements when the T1 LS drama broke out. If you guys at T1 genuinely cared, you could have reached out to him and told him that he should refrain from “causing trouble” when it first happens, instead of just booting him off as a mod when whatever he does becomes an issue for you guys.\n\nBeing told that we are unable to moderate this server and protect the users in there was unbelievable. T1’s response to everything that transpired in this discord was just so, so awful. Racist and homophobic slurs were everywhere, and it does not take much to think about locking this discord server when the outlash first broke out. I have suggested locking this discord multiple times for the sake of this community and preventing this discord situation from escalating, but I have been told to just watch T1cord descend into chaos with my own two eyes.\n\nI don’t know how you expect us mods to still stick with you after how badly you have treated us throughout this situation.

Good luck on your moderator search I guess!\n\nAs a fan, I am deeply displeased with how the org has been handling things. I believe that it is just sheer human decency for you to protect your staff. LS is facing an inhumane amount of harassment by your fans, and the most you can do is publish a meaningless statement with white text on black and hope that quells the angry fans?
